# The Zoo

This project was built with React and Styled components.

## The brief

Create a SPA (in react with typescript) that contains a start page where the animals are presented with names and a short description. It should be possible to click on an animal to see more information about this animal via an own route. From the animal's own page, you should be able to mark whether the animal is now fed or not via a button called Feed animal. When you click on this button, the status of the animal must change so that it appears that it has been fed. And it should no longer be possible to click the button. You also need to enter the time the animal was fed.

The next time you go to the animal's side, if more than three hours have passed since the last feeding it must be possible to feed the animal again. For a little extra challenge, you should present a small notice on the start page, as well as on the animal side, that an animal needs to be fed if it is more than four hours since the animal was fed.
